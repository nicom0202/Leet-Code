---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
 

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (1) Have two pointers. One pointer at the front of the string & one at the end of the string
    (2) Check if numbers[front] + numbers[back] is greater than, less than or equal to target
    (3) Adjust pointers depeneding on answer

ğŸ”¹SolutionğŸ”¹
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
front = 0
back = size of list - 1
while front < back:
    if s[front] + s[back] < target
        front++
    if s[front] + s[back] > target 
        back--
    if s[front] + s[back] == target
        return [front, back]

O(n)
Why? - Pointers check all values in the list until the last two possibilites are available
